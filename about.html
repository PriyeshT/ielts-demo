                At IELTS COUNCIL, we are focused on providing  professional training
                with an aim to help our students to achieve the desired band score.

                succeeding in IELTS.</p>
              <p>IELTS is the ticket to open the gates for foreign studies &amp; immigration.
                Conutries like UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA have made it mandatory
                for aspirants to have cleared the IELTS with certain levels of band score.
              </p>
              <p>IELTS is a tough examination &amp; requires sincere efforts to get through.
                It is just not about clearing the IELTS but more importantly about achieving the
                desired band score. For this you will require guidance from someone who has experience with the exams.</p>
              <p>This is where IELTS COUNCIL steps in. Our facilitator is certified 'Teacher of IELTS'
                from the prestigious London Teacher Training College (LTTC), UK. He has as well achieved
                the band score of 8 bands in the recently conducted IELTS exams.
                Thus he has an insight of the IELTS both, as a teacher &amp; a student.</p>

              <p class="text-justify">
                IELTS COUNCIL was especially set up for the students from suburbs. It was noticed that the suburban belt
                beyond Thane does not have eminent coaching facilities for IELTS. </p><p>There are centres in Andheri,
                Thane, Dadar, but due the current hectic lifestyle it is very difficult to commute to this places in
                addition to the daily college or job. So why should the suburban aspirants feel deprived?</p>
                <p>NO...they dont have to feel 'left behind' anymore.
                Now we have the world class IELTS COUNCIL in DOMBIVLI !!!
                Suburban students now don't have to commute all the way up to Thane or Andheri to attend classes.
              </p>

            <div class="advantage">
              <h2 class="text-center">The Advantage</h2>
              <p>
                IELTS COUNCIL understands the exact needs of students from suburban areas &amp;
                is conceptualised to address those needs.

              <ul class="adv-list">
                <li class="adv-list-item">We have the lowest fees as compared to any other classes because we
                  don't consider ourselves a coaching class or institute, but as a friendly council to
                  help you achieve your goal.</li>
                <li class="adv-list-item">We disdain the whole classroom atmosphere in the coaching centres all around.
                  Instead of cramping students just to earn money, we limit or student intake &amp; provide the training
                  in a "feel-at-home" yet professional atmosphere.</li>
                <li class="adv-list-item">Individual attention is provided at the IELTS COUNCIL &amp;
                  the support is extended well beyond the class hours.</li>
                <li class="adv-list-item">Convenient weekend schedule facilitates attendance for students of
                  varied vocations.</li>
